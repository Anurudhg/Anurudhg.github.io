## FAB LAB TRAINING (2ND AUG 2017-)
                Being the part of FABLAB training was a great oppurtunity.No one ever  would miss that.The central theme of FABLAB is 'HOW TO MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING'.
                 
## DAY ONE (GLIMPSES OF REALISATION)
   
Our trainer Mr.Jaseel was successful in explaining the main theme of the entire programme.He made as aware about the future scopes of FAB and was able to convince as how the same can influence the future world.
### fablab
   
 To put it very simply, fab lab is a mini factory of sorts where anyone can work on an idea and build a prototype, which would then help to figure out potential market for the product.It has wide variety of machines to make thing possible as we wish.Anything can be rebuild with a short span without much complicated manufacturing procedures.
   
```markdown
   $ Precision cutter
   $ Carving machine
   $ Drillers
   $ Laser cutter
   $ Milling machines
   $ 3D printers 
   $ Moulding machines
   $ Mini furnaces
```
    
                                                   The above mentioned are some of the important machines and tools used for making your come true into its physical format.While fab labs have yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products, they have already shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves. These devices can be tailored to local or personal needs in ways that are not practical or economical using mass production.

### Precision cutter 
               
<img src="precision.jpg" height="300" width="500">     
     
 A CNC Engraving machine is the art of cutting or carving grooves  
 or characters into a surface. The more common forms are hand eng
 raving, mechanical engraving (pantographs, computer engravers, 
 CNC engraving, etc.) and a variety of photographic and chemical
 etching processes.Rotary Engraving, or CNC Routing, is done with
 a rotating tool or cutter in a motorized spindle. The process is
 similar to routing and is used to produce cuts of specified widths
 and depths in a wide variety of materials.
 
### Drillers
                                                         
                                                         
In rock drilling, the hole is usually not made through a circular 
cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, the 
hole is usually made by hammering a drill bit into the hole with
quickly repeated short movements. The hammering action can be pe
rformed from outside of the hole (top-hammer drill) or within the
hole (down-the-hole drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drill
ing are called drifter drills.

### Laser cutter

Laser cutting is a precise method of cutting a design from a given
material using a CAD file to guide it. There are three main types 
of lasers used in the industry: CO2 lasers Nd and Nd-YAG. We use 
CO 2 machines. This involves firing a laser which cuts by melting,
burning or vaporizing your material. You can achieve a really fine
level of cutting detail on with a wide variety of materials. Bare 
in mind that CO 2 lasers can’t cut metals and hard materials, they
can however engrave them
 
### Milling machine

<img src="milling-machine.jpg" height="300" width="500">

The milling machines are also known as the multi-tasking machines 
(MTMs) which are multi-purpose machines capable of milling and tu
rning the materials as well. The milling machine has got the cutt
er installed up on it which helps in removing the material from t
he surface of the work piece. When the material gets cooled down 
then it is removed from the milling machine.

### 3D Printers

3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three
dimensional solid objects from a digital file.The creation of a 3D
printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additi
ve process an object is created by laying down successive layers 
of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can 
be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventu
al object

### Moulding machine

<img src="moulding.jpg" height="300" width="500">

Injection molding machine molds can be fastened in either a horizo
ntal or vertical position. The majority of machines are horizontal
ly oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applicat
ions such as insert molding, allowing the machine to take advantage
of gravity. Some vertical machines also don't require the mold to 
be fastened. There are many ways to fasten the tools to the platens
, the most common being manual clamps (both halves are bolted to t
he platens); however hydraulic clamps (chocks are used to hold the
tool in place) and magnetic clamps are also used

### Mini furnaces

<img src="mini furnace.jpg" height="300" width="500">

Furnaces feature rugged ceramic tops and bottoms with durable alum
inum alloy sides. As a result, they are 20 to 25 percent lighter t
han comparable ceramic-shell furnaces and 40 to 45 percent lighter
than aluminum-frame furnaces. This reduction in furnace weight is 
a particularly important consideration in hand pouring operations
. Their removable front and back inspection and access panels make
Mini-Melt™ Furnaces easier to maintain and cost less to repair th
an shell furnaces and aluminum frame furnaces. These furnaces ha
ve a strong, durable construction for long furnace life. They al
so operate at frequencies from 3,000 to 10,000 hertz  with maxim
um power utilization

## DAY FOUR(VINLY CUTTING)
    
 A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small
 vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer contro
 ls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out
 shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic 
 (vinyl).We can design and print various stickers according to 
 our need.It is a sophesticated system with high range of prec
 ision and provide sgood print quality.It too need any input 
 design for furnishing the product.

### DESIGNING FOR LASER PRINTER

If you want to cut out model
$Design a 2D model for the laser printing
$Use any softwares like:Paint
                        Solidworks
                        Rhino
                        Auotocad etc... which give give vector output
 
<img src="key.jpg" height="600" width="800"> 
 
$Save it in DXF format in case of Solidworks
&Open it in RHINO and adjust the size or dimension ratio if required
$Then save as PDF format and print

<img src="dxf.jpg" height="600" width="800">
<img src="rino.jpg height="600" width="800">

 ### $*** Remember the laser will cut out through the drawing you designed
         
I can share one of the failure of the product due to error in the design
As I designed the almost the same model this way:

If you want to just engrave something on surface
$Choose any suitable black and white photo (if not convert using any photo
editor)
$Save it in PDF format
$Select 'PRINT' from 'FILE' menu or print directly from the editor

<img src="keyprint.jpg" height="600" width="800">

$In print setup select the laser printer
$When the print setup dialogue box of laser printer  is displayed
    Choose 'RASTOR'-FOR ENGRAVING
           'VECTOR'-FOR CUTTING
    Select the power and cutting speed
            RASTOR- speed:30-40%
                                }changes according to material[trail&
                                  error method can be adopted]                             
                    power:20-40%
            VECTOR- speed:30-50%
                                }changes according to material[trail
                                  error method can be adopted]  
                    power:70-80%
 $I adopted the above mentioned vector specifications on cutting on acrylic sheet
 $Now click the 'OK' button
 
<img src="print setup.png" height="600" width="800"> 
 
 $Check the screen of the laser printer "JOB:YOUR FILE NAME" appeares
 $If already a job is appearing click 'BIN' button to delete
 $Also use "SAVE" to save the job into the machine
 $Click 'RESET' to set the point of starting work
 $Press button no 9 to display the laser pointer position
 $Now press 'X/Y OFF' to free the robotic arm and to manually set the starting poi
 nt.The co-ordinates appears on the screen
